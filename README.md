# Vectoree

A flat tree-ish data structure, which is crammed into a bunch of maps, thus a kind of a "vectorized tree".

> âš  The project is currently in an early state - things may change rapidly.

## Usage

Add `vectoree` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:vectoree, "~> 0.0.2"}
  ]
end
```
